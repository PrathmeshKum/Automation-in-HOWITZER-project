# Automation-in-HOWITZER-project

*Discrete Neural Network Project files*

1. Fuzzy logic system from point mass differential trajectory equations to develop firing table.
2. Neural network using back propagation algorithm to develop basic firing table of HOWITZERS.
3. The models predict angle of firing for given wind and target distance values.
